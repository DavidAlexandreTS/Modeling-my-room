# Computer Graphics Course Project â€“ 2020.1

<h1> Project Information </h1>
<br />
The requirements requested in Assignment 1 and Assignment 2 have been implemented (except for the correct implementation of spot lighting), including modeling of mandatory objects, opening windows and doors using the keyboard, among others.
<br />
About the keyboard functionalities:
<br />
The popular Up Arrow key moves the observer forward, while the Down Arrow key moves the observer backward.
<br />
The Left Arrow key turns the observer to the left, similarly, the Right Arrow key turns the observer to the right.
<br />
The PageDown and PageUp keys are used to move the observer down and up, respectively.
<br />
Pressing the "o" key opens the door, while the "c" key closes it.
<br />
Similarly, the "w" key opens the window and the "t" key closes it.
<br />
Note: As part of the grade for Assignment 2, diffuse and specular lighting were added as requested.
<br />

<h1> How to Run </h1>
<br />
<h2> Linux </h2>
<br />
On Linux, after installing all dependencies, simply run the compilation commands for OpenGL programs. It is worth mentioning that to run on Linux (or even on Windows without using VSCode), just download the files located in the "DavidsRoom" folder.
<br />

<h2> Windows </h2>
<br />
On Windows, there are several ways to run it; the method I used was through Visual Studio. There are many tutorials online that can help with installing the dependencies and running the project on your machine. I will provide the link I used for setup in the references section.
